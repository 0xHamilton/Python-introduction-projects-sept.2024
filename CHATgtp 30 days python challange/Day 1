#Write a program that asks the user for two numbers and performs basic math operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
x=int(input("what is the first number ?"))
y=int(input("what is the second number ?"))
#perfoming basic operation
add=x+y
sub=x-y
multiply=x*y
divide=x/y

#display the result with descriptive message
print(f"the sum of both numbers is:{add}")
print(f"the subtrction of both number is :{sub}")
print(f"the product of  both number is:{multiply}")
print(f"the division of both number is:{divide}")
